# Garbage Collector Hugo Theme

This is a Hugo Theme I've made for my blog [Garbage Collector](https://blog.zedas.fr) for the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It is based on the [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) framework with some customization and have some inspiration took from the [Casper3](https://github.com/jonathanjanssens/hugo-casper3) theme previously used for this blog.

This theme was made for my own blog, so there is not warranty that it'll fit for any other Hugo site. However, feel free to use it, customize it, enhance it, and so on.

Supports pagination, multilingual, categories, and RSS generator.

As I'm not a web developer, if some code parts of this theme makes your eyes bleed, please forgive me.

Then, in your config file (YAML example) :
