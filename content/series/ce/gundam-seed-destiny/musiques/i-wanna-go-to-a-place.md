I Wanna Go To A Place...
------------------------

I Wanna Go To A Place...  
  
- Chant : Rie fu  
- Arrangements par SNORKEL  
  
I wanna to a place where I can say   
That I'm all right and I'm staying there with you   
I wanna know if there could be anyway   
That there's no fight, and I'm safe and sound with you   
  
And everytime I look, I thought you were there,   
But it was just my imagination   
I don't see it anymore cause I see thru you now   
  
imademo kidzukanai deshou kono shizuka na sora ni   
itsudemo omoidasu kedo mou doko nimo modorenai   
  
soshite zutto kokoro de samete sotto kidzuite   
itsuka kitto yasashisa mietekuru you ni   
  
What's stopping me? I get stuck again   
Is it really OK? It's never OK for me   
What's got into me? I get lost again   
Is it really OK? It's never going to be   
  
soshite motto sagashite me no mae ni kidzuite   
asu wa kitto kazamuki mo kawaru you ni   
kaze ga sotto sasayaku ugomeku nowa kono daichi   
mayawanaide yasashisa mietekuru you ni   
  
And every time I look, I thought you were there,   
But it was just my imagination   
I don't see it anymore cause I see thru you now   
  
I wanna go to a place where I can say   
That I'm all right and I'm staying there with you
