Paroles anglaises


can i find the words to tell you   
 how i live between the walls of steel and stone   
 how i close my eyes to find some kind of rapture   
 in a world where you can feel so all alone   
  
 inside i'm full of light and laughter   
 there's a flame that burns in me   
 i need a way to set it free   
  
 when you find love in your heart   
 you can believe from the start   
 dreams they come true   
 it all comes to you, oh all at once   
 if you believe   
 in human touch   
  
 i see wanting in your eyes   
 and i wonder will   
 i always think of you   
 do we simply find ourselves   
 awakening   
 as angles touched   
 the heartstrings of our souls   
  
 we can find a way   
 to break the madness   
 take my hand and come with me   
 to a place where we can feel   
  
 when you find love in your heart   
 the light in your eye is a star   
 change that you feel   
 helps you to heal from all the rest   
 if you believe   
 in human touch   
  
 tell me that your love   
 will live forever   
 take your hand and touch my face   
 oh, the warmth of your sweet embrace   
  
 when you find love in your heart   
 nothing can tear it apart   
 not man of steel   
 nothing is real except for love   
 if you believe   
 in human touch   
 if you believe   
 in human touch
